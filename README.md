# Universal Vue with Nuxt
-------------------------

This repository includes 5 sample projects that work their way up in increasing
complexity to demonstrate the usefulness and complexity of universal JavaScript
and [Nuxt](http://www.nuxtjs.org). These files are companion files to the talk
["Universal Vue with Nuxt"](https://www.meetup.com/Central-Virginia-Javascript-Enthusiasts-CVJSE/events/244577680/).
